# lanadelslay
truly the most slay individual

want to run her yourself?
head over to https://discord.com/developers/
then, create a new bot. once it's all set up there, download this repository. create a new file called ".env". inside, it should contain one line, "TOKEN=[your token here]". once you've done that, open a terminal, type "python3 bot.py" (make sure you have python installed first), and lana will come alive!
